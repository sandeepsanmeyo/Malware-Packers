Malware Packers

Packers:
This usually is short for “runtime packers” which are also known as “self-extracting archives”. Software that unpacks itself in memory when the “packed file” is executed. Sometimes this technique is also called “executable compression”. This type of compression was invented to make files smaller. So users wouldn’t have to unpack them manually before they could be executed. But given the current size of portable media and internet speeds, the need for smaller files is not that urgent anymore. So when you see some packers being used nowadays, it is almost always for malicious purposes. In essence to make reverse engineering more difficult, with the added benefit of a smaller footprint on the infected machine.

In essence, a malware packer is a tool used to mask a malicious file. Packers can encrypt, compress or simply change the format of a malware file to make it look like something else entirely. The process of packer compression or encryption takes the file from its original code to a new state using tried-and-true obfuscation techniques. 

Malware can remain in a system undetected by antivirus software, anti-malware products and other security software, harming the integrity of your system and the security of your data. This is why it is so important to understand how packers can be used in malware. 

Types of Malware Packers:

1) Obsidium
Obsidium works for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows applications. This software is capable of encrypting, compressing, and obfuscating malware.

2) VMProtect
VMProtect is very popular, as it can encrypt a wide range of files, including executable files, drivers and dynamic-link libraries. When an application encrypted by VMProtect is opened, the packer does not decrypt anything; instead, it runs on a virtualized code.

3) Andromeda
While Andromeda refers to a botnet that has been around since 2011, it is also a custom packer. Custom packers are especially dangerous because they are not as simple to reverse-engineer.

4) PESpin
PESpin compresses Windows code using MASM. It protects files against patching and disassembling, making it a popular resource for malware authors.

5) FSG
The free, simple FSG software compresses both small and large files. While it is popular and commonly used to hide malware code, it is also relatively simple to unpack through a decompression loop that writes the data to the final destination.

6) MEW
MEW is primarily used for smaller malware file compression using the LZMA algorithm. Even though it was designed for small files, it has been updated over time so that it can also obfuscate larger malware files.

7) Themida
Themida was developed by Oreans to protect Windows applications from hackers. Unfortunately, it can also be used to encrypt malicious files and complicate attempts to reverse-engineer malware.

8) Morphine
Unlike most other packers, Morphine includes its own PE loader, allowing users to encrypt the output of compressed data. The polymorphic engine is also used to create completely unique decryptors for malware.

9) ExeStealth
ExeStealth is a tool that encrypts files to avoid detection and hacking. Designed by WebToolMaster, this free software is simple to implement and one of the best anti-hacking tools on the market, which also makes it effective at hiding malware code in your system.

10) Exe Packer 2.300
Exe Packer 2.300 is a standard, free software for file compression and decompression. Since it has been around for years, Exe Packer 2.300 is one of the most popular packers for malicious file obfuscation.

11) MPRESS
MPRESS was originally designed to compress files and decrease application start times. While this free software is extremely useful for regular file compression, it is also easily accessible to hackers and other malware writers.

12) The Enigma Protector
Like most packers, The Enigma Protector is marketed for individuals and businesses who want to protect their files from hacking. Nonetheless, The Enigma Protector is commonly used to unclear malware.

13) UPX
UPX is short for the “Ultimate Packer for Executables.” It uses an open-source algorithm that does not require any additional system memory for decompression.
